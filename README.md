Semester project1
In this project I am developing a website for the new science museum opening in my town. It´s called Community Science Museum and the target audience is primary- and middle school pupils, and familier with small children. The website should be informative and and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit. The website should be responsive and easy to navigate over various devices.
